# Match Heroes

## Concept

Match Heroes is trying to connect users to businesses for job opportunities. This is done trough a Tinder like fashion where the user can like a business, and when the business is interested in the user. The business can like the user back. Where afterwards a chat can be started. 

### Why matching

Mailing is oldschool and I think we need new ways to connect to businesses. And it is also disappointing to send many mails to many businesses to just never get a reply. Whenever you like a business, you'll probably forget you liked that business. But when you get liked back, you'll probably get a satisfaction out of it, and the communication will be realtime. Wich feels more personal than just an email. 

## Realtime technologies

The realtime technology i've used is socket.io. It is a good library for creating realtime applications. It is hard to grasp at first because the client code looks almost identical to the serverside code. But it is a fun library to use. Especially when you start playing with namespaces.
